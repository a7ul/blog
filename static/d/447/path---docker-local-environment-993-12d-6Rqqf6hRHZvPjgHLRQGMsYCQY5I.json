As a new engineer on the team, I had to setup the entire development environment. Drawing my expectations from my previous work engagements I thought this would take me a couple of days. But to my surprise I had a working setup of quite a few backend services written in NodeJS, Golang and Python along side the web site and portal (Javascript) in ~5hrs.\nThis post will explain on how we use Docker at Anyfin to setup a productive local development environment.</p>\n<p><strong>üëÆüèª‚ÄçCredit disclaimer:üö®</strong> <br/>\nThe entire credit for the setup goes to my colleagues: Kim, Niemi, Asparuh, Pepijn and Sven.

And as a new engineer on the team, I had to setup the entire development environment. In my head I had thought this would probably take a few days (as I have experienced in my previous work engagements). But to my surprise I was up and running in only about half a working day (thats approx 4hrs). At Anyfin we have quite a few of backend services written in NodeJS, Golang and Python along side the web site and portal (Javascript).\nI found the setup at Anyfin extremely awesome and hence wanted to share it with everyone. This post will detail on how to effectively use Docker for setting up your local development environment. The entire credit goes to my colleagues: Kim, Niemi, Asparuh, Pepijn and Sven. I am just documenting it 😬.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"🐳 Simplified guide to using Docker for local development environment","date":"December 06, 2018","keywords":"docker, local, development, environment, guide, javascript","featuredImage":null},"fields":{"slug":"/docker-local-environment/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/docker-local-environment/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/react-custom-renderer-2/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"⚛️✌️ Part 2/3 - Beginners guide to Custom React Renderers.

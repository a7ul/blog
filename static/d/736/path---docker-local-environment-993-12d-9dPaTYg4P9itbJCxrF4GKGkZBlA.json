As a new engineer on the team, I had to setup the entire development environment. Drawing my expectations from my previous work engagements I thought this would take me a couple of days. But to my surprise I had a working setup of quite a few backend services written in NodeJS, Golang and Python along side the web site and portal (Javascript) in ~5hrs.\nThis post will explain on how we use Docker at Anyfin to setup a productive local development environment quite easily. I have seen such attempts at my previous workplaces before but none of those have worked as seamlessly as the one we have here.</p>\n<p><strong>üëÆüèª‚ÄçCredit disclaimer:üö®</strong> <br/>\nThe entire credit for the setup goes to my colleagues: Kim, Niemi, Asparuh, Pepijn and Sven. I found the setup at Anyfin extremely awesome and hence wanted to share it with everyone.</p>\n<h2>Example Architecture üß¶</h2>\n<p>Lets say we have a set of services that have the following architecture.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/architecture-f069ee90ad81928b31443a2451837f10.svg\" alt=\"example architecture\"></p>\n<p>From the diagram we can see we have:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>NJS1 - NodeJS service running on port <strong>7000</strong> and dependent on the database Db1 (running on port <strong>5433</strong>).</li>\n<li>Py1 - Python service running on port <strong>9000</strong> and dependent on the database Db1 (running on port <strong>5433</strong>).</li>\n<li>Go1 - Golang service running on port <strong>5000</strong> and dependent on the database Db1 (running on port <strong>5433</strong>).</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>NJS2 - NodeJS service running on port <strong>8000</strong> and dependent on the database Db2 (running on port <strong>5432</strong>).</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<ul>\n<li>Web - A simple webpack based dev server for frontend running on port <strong>8080</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>PS: We want the services to be exposed on the said ports in the local environment so that they can communicate with each other via those.</em></p>\n<p>For simplicity, lets consider that all of these services just return the message:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Hello from &lt;service name&gt;</code></pre></div>\n<p>So, if you hit <strong>GET <a href=\"http://localhost:7000\">http://localhost:7000</a></strong>, you should get</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">Hello from njs1</code></pre></div>\n<p>The code for these services are here: <a href=\"https://github.com/master-atul/blog-docker-dev-environment-example\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/master-atul/blog-docker-dev-environment-example</a></p>\n<p>Lets run all of our services on different terminal windows and try it out.\n<br/></p>\n<h2>We typically face these issues with this setup üí©</h2>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Terminal hell:</strong> To run all of those services, we would need to open up mulitple terminal tabs/windows and then run them separately (It would look like this).

In such cases we would need to manually switch node versions before running our services. Similarly, if our services depend on multiple database servers, then we would need to make sure our database servers are running (on different ports) before we can run our services. All of this is mostly manual and cumbersome.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Fresh setup</strong>: Setting up all of this services on a new machine can be tricky as we need to keep track of all the dependencies we need and their corresponding versions.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>All of these are frankly annoying ü§Ø.</p>\n<h2>Docker based local development environment üï∂</h2>\n<p>Follow the docker setup instructions here <a href=\"https://www.docker.com/get-started\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.docker.com/get-started</a> to set it up on your computer.</p>\n<p>Each of our service will use a Dockerfile which will describe the environment that our service will run on.</p>\n<h3>Docker Compose</h3>\n<h2>Some Tips for smoother workflow</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"üê≥ Simplified guide to using Docker for local development environment","date":"March 26, 2019","keywords":"docker, local, development, environment, guide, javascript","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":null}},"fields":{"slug":"/docker-local-environment/"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/docker-local-environment/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/rate-limiter/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"üöß An alternative approach to building a simple API Rate limiter using NodeJS and Redis"}},"next":null}}

A blog post in 2014 [here](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html) tells us that Google's search engine ranks HTTPS websites over unsecure HTTP websites.\n\n## What is HTTPS?\n>HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an internet communication protocol that protects the integrity and confidentiality of data between the user's computer and the site. Users expect a secure and private online experience when using a website. We encourage you to adopt HTTPS in order to protect your users' connections to your website, regardless of the content on the site.\n\n\n\n\n## References\nhttps://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6073543?hl=en\nhttps://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/02/08/google_chrome_http_shame/\n","frontmatter":{"title":"üîê HTTPS certificate generation explained!

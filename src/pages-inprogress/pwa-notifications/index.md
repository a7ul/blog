One of most effective ways to re-engage users to your apps are using Push Notifications. 

A push notification can be of two types:<br/>
1. Local Notification: This is generated by your app itself. 
2. Remote Notification: This is generated by a server.


## Overview

The steps involved in making a local push notification: <br/>
1. Ask for permission from the user using the Notification APIs `requestPermission` method.
2. If permission granted : Brilliant! Now use the registration from service worker to generate a push notification.
3. If permission denied : Politely, Fuck off: Your content is too boring for your users to subscribe to your notifications.
